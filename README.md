# dockerized-dev-tools - Unified Docker Images Collection

Ubuntu, DinD, DooD &amp; multi programming language dev-container build scripts.

This repository hosts a collection of scripts and Dockerfiles designed to streamline development and deployment processes. It includes a base Ubuntu rolling image with essential command-line tools, Docker-in-Docker (DinD), Docker-outside-of-Docker (DooD), and specialized images tailored for development containers.

## Features

This repo contains build scripts and docker files to create the following docker images:

### Stage 1: Base Images

1. **ubuntu-base**: This is the base image with Ubuntu setup, which serves as a foundation for other images.
2. **devbox-base**: Built upon the ubuntu-base, it includes essential tools and configurations common across the dev environments.
3. **devbox-helm**: This includes Helm setup, configured and ready to use for Kubernetes package management.

### Stage 2: Scripting Images

In this stage, several images are built in parallel to save time. All of these images are based on **devbox-helm**. These images are:

1. **devbox-scripting**: An image that contians all of the stage 2 scripting languages dev tools.
2. **devbox-python**: A Python development environment.
3. **devbox-ruby**: A Ruby development environment.
4. **devbox-perl**: A Perl development environment.
5. **devbox-node**: A Node.js development environment, ideal for JavaScript and TypeScript development.
6. **devbox-powershell**: A PowerShell development environment, tailored for Windows PowerShell scripting.

### Stage 3: High-Level Images

This stage focuses on building images for high-level programming languages. All of these images are based on **devbox-scripting**:

1. **devbox-java**: An environment suited for Java development, including JDK setup.
2. **devbox-dotnet**: A .NET development environment with necessary SDKs and runtimes.
3. **devbox-go**: A Go development environment with the Go language SDK installed.

### Stage 4: Ultimate Image

1. **devbox-ultimate**: This image integrates elements from all the above images, providing a comprehensive development environment with a wide array of tools and SDKs, making it the ultimate development toolbox.

## Getting Started

This guide will help you to get started with building and using the development environment docker images.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Git
- Bash

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ernst-fastl/dockerized-dev-tools.git
cd dockerized-dev-tools
```

### Building Images

#### Building All Images

To build all the images at once, you can use the ./build-all.sh script. Simply run:

```bash
./build-all.sh
```

Expect the build to run approx. 15-20 minutes. Build logs of the docker images are in ./build-logs.

#### Building a Single Image

To build a single image, use the ./build.sh script followed by the folder name of the image you wish to build. For example, to build the devbox-java image, you would run:

```bash
./build.sh devbox-java
```

### Help

Both build.sh and build-all.sh scripts support the -h and --help options to provide more information on how to use the scripts. Use them as follows:

```bash
./build.sh -h
# or
./build-all.sh --help
```

Now you are ready to build and explore the dockerized development environments. Happy coding!

## Usage

### VSCode and JetBrains IDE Dev Containers

You can leverage the `devbox` images as development containers in both VSCode and JetBrains IDEs. Doing so provides you with a pre-configured, isolated development environment with all the necessary tools at your fingertips.

Follow the official guides to set up dev containers:

- [VSCode Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)
- [JetBrains Dev Containers](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21962-dev-containers)

### Permanently running containers

You can leverage the `devbox` images as development containers in both VSCode and JetBrains IDEs. This provides you with a pre-configured, isolated development environment with all the necessary tools readily available.

To make the most of this, you can set up the containers to run permanently and even start automatically upon system startup. Once running, you can connect to these containers through the following methods:

#### VSCode

Use the 'Attach to Container' feature to connect to a running container. Find more details in the [official guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/attach-container).

#### JetBrains

Connect to the container using the 'Remote Development' feature. Learn how to set it up from the [official guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/).

### CI/CD Slave Containers

Besides serving as dev containers, these `devbox` images can also be utilized as base images for CI slave containers, furnishing them with the necessary environments and tools to streamline your CI/CD pipelines.

To reference one of these images in your CI configuration, use the appropriate image name (for instance, `devbox-java`, `devbox-python`, etc.) from this repository.
