# Ubuntu DevBox Container

This Docker image provides a ready-to-use development environment based on the latest rolling release of Ubuntu. It is designed to be a flexible and convenient environment for developers.

## Features

- **Latest Ubuntu Rolling Release**: Always stay up to date with the latest Ubuntu packages.
- **Unminimized Image**: Includes a full range of utilities and tools for development.
- **Homebrew Installation**: Homebrew is pre-installed for convenient package management.
- **User Configuration**: The default user `ubuntu` is renamed to `user` with sudo privileges and no-password access.
- **Bash Shell**: The container starts with a Bash login shell for interactive use.

## Building the Image

To build the image, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run:

```bash
docker build -t ubuntu-devbox .
```

## Running the Container

To run the container, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu-devbox
```

This will start the container with an interactive Bash shell.

## Custom Scripts

The image includes custom scripts located in the `/opt/devbox` directory. These are copied from the local `scripts/` directory during the build process.

- **`apt-clean-install.sh`**: This script updates, upgrades, installs APT packages, and cleans up unused files. It is intended to be used with a RUN command in a Dockerfile to create a clean layer.
- **`brew-clean-install.sh`**: This script updates, upgrades, installs Homebrew packages, and cleans up unused files. It is intended to be used with a RUN command in a Dockerfile to create a clean layer.

Feel free to modify or add additional scripts as needed for your development workflow.
